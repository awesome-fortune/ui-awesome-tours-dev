Online ticket booking system ui built on angular

Kindly note that this is only the front end of the awesome-tours ticket booking system,
you need to have the [api](https://github.com/awesome-fortune/api-awesome-tours) running in order for the app
to work.

Usage: Running the app locally

1. Serve the app using your favourite web server
2. Sign up for an admin user (At the moment, we can only use awesome_admin as the admin username)
3. Login to the admin panel on [localhost/#/admin]()
